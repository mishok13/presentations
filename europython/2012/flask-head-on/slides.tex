%% Diving into Flask (Head On)

Intro

What we've built

Based on our experience with social networks and pressing necessity
in integrating with other social networks, we have decided to create
a unifying API. It's similar to Janrein, Gigya and Spring Social in many
ways, but being built in-house gives us some advantages over 3rd party
solutions (read: MONEY)
We have strict requirements in terms of availability and speed of
development.

Decision for Flask

Flask started as an April's Fool joke, but look who's laughing now. Armin's not
laughing, because he has to support it nowadays. But seriously, Flask is a very
mature project nowadays and provides you with everything you need to
modern build web applications. SQLAlchemy, no template needs, etc made flask
a better option than Django.


%% celery

%% how celery behaves with various

%% celery lack of init_app

%% celery logging -- color formatting, hijacking root logger


%% detaching celery

%% sqlalchemy and celery -- issues with pool (INVESTIGATE!!! postgres too)

%% flask URL routing with RESTful interfaces

%% reading forms is slow

%% batching API -- how we did it

%% sqlalchemy flask -- indices

%% sqlalchemy migrate -- how to

%% logging -- how to

%% blueprints -- awesome

%% caching -- werkzeug.contrib.cache and consistent hashing


%% werkzeug routing -- how routes are compiled and methods checked

%% filter and validate URL parameters

%% uwsgi scaling (also talk about gunicorn)

%% werkzeug profiler, flask-debugtoolbar
%% memory?
%% cache profiling?
%% statsd integration
%% (Sentry also?)
